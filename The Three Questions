Acting as a hotel board and having access to the data in the original data file,
I will pose the following questions and determine the best way to demonstrate an answer.

The Questions:

1) Which are the peak booking periods throughout the year?
  a) How long in advance are these peaks booked?
2) How many cancellations or no-shows do we get?
  a) Is there a trend for this, such as specific days or room types?
3) What is the room type preference?
  
Using Microsoft BI, I will visualise the answers as best I can.
